/*
    DiscordBAM - Ban Appeal Manager (Google Sheets - Mobile hotfix)
    Version 0.1
    Created by : thatpaple#9995
 
    This method is not as info-rich in terms of logging, but it does work on mobile devices.
      This method does not have the fill-in form from Google-Sheets.gs.
     
    There are a few variables you have to fill in. On line 18, you have to replace "PLACE_WEBHOOK_HERE" with a webhook.
    I recommend using a webhook from modlogs!
    
    If you have any questions, please reach out!
